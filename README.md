## Challenges 
The largest hurdle was figuring out how to take the data from the index.js and populate it into the database but after looking through it with some classmates and my instructor I was able to get the application working properly. 

## Credits 
I was able to create what I did from working with our instructor at the bootcamp as well as working with other classmates while using online sources.
